## P10 test:

Terminal_Output_P10 is the output file for game logic testing.
In this test, I used shell interface to introduce player to enter command.
1.Roll(and move.)
2.Stop
3.Remove
I tested with 3 players. __P1__ __P2__ and __P3__ color is orange yellow and green.
TEST strategy:
__P1__ choose Remove at the first turn.
__P2__ Roll 3 times and won column 12.
__P2__ stop his turn.
__P3__ Roll a few times and go bust.Turn to __P2__.
__P2__ Roll a few times and won column 6 and column 8 at the same time.
__P2__ won 3 columns, Game over.

Input dice file: fake_input.txt.(in this file, dice values is used before comments.)

Terminal_Output_P10_exceptions_test is the output file for exception part testing.
I tested same name, and same color situations.
I didnt use CheckData() funtions. I did mask filter in my getNewPlayer() functions.

## P11 test:

Test strategy is same with P10. 
Choose "Show Scoreboard" after __P1__ resigned to demonstrate the print() function works well.
Input game history file named SBinput.txt.
Output game history file named SBoutput.txt.
If only use one file to record game history, this program works well,
only thing need to change is modify "INF" in line 23, ScoreBoard.cpp to "OUTF",
it will take output file as input file.
