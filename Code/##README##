## P12 Documentation:

Table of techniques:
1. Redefine operator: Function: char* operator ~(string str), line 35 in ScoreBoard.hpp.
2. const: Function: roll() Class: Dice, line 35 in dice.hpp.
          Line 30, 31, 32 in enums.hpp.
          Class: Game, line 44 in game.hpp.
3. ctors: Class: Dice, line 13 in dice.cpp.

Proof no memory leaks: Because 10.13 MacOS High Sierra don't support Valgrind, I used cnt++
in constructor and cout<<--cnt in destructor. I used $$$FREE MEMORY$$$ prefix in Terminal_Output_p12.

UML diagram, UML of dice, state diagram for oneTurn and interaction diagram for oneTurn all included in this directory.

Makefile also in this directory.
